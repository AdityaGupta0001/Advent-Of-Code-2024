# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges! This repo contains solutions to the daily coding puzzles provided during the event. Each solution is implemented in **Python** with an emphasis on **simplicity and clarity** to help everyone understand the logic.

## 🌟 About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th. These puzzles are fun, challenging, and a great way to practice problem-solving and coding skills.

## 🐍 Why Python?

Python is chosen for its readability and ease of use, making the solutions approachable for beginners and intermediate programmers.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into folders, one for each day of the challenge:

```
├── Day01
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 1
│   ├── solution.py     # Python script for Day 1 solution
├── Day02
│   ├── input.txt       # Puzzle input for Day 2
│   ├── solution.py     # Python script for Day 2 solution
...
```

Each folder contains:
- `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day's challenge.
- `solution.py`: The Python script implementing the solution.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/advent-of-code-2024.git
   cd advent-of-code-2024
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's folder:
   ```bash
   cd Day01
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
